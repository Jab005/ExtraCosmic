## ITEM: DESCRIPTION
item.jab-ec-chondrite.description = Most common stone-type mineral that can be found in asteroids. Contains metal inside of it.
item.jab-ec-radhox.description = Dangerous radioactive stone that formed in deep space. It formed when chondrite is exposed to star radiation ray for around million of years.
item.jab-ec-cosmonium.description = Exotic strange soft metal that rarely can be found in cosmic space. Emitting dark energy pulses in some states.
item.jab-ec-techronite.description = Strange purple luminous crystal that comes from outer space. Reflecting light strangely than other crystals.
item.jab-ec-rheozen.description = Slightly energized metal. Mostly used for electronics stuff.
item.jab-ec-antalumite.description = Light reflective metallic resource. Mostly used for liquid and laser infrastructure purposes.
item.jab-ec-candrum.description = Dense and strong metal. Formed from raw metal that exposed to weak cosmic radiation.
item.jab-ec-star-core.description = The small core of the star. Formed around millions of years from solidified fusion. Highly emits energy for long periods.
item.jab-ec-star-fragment.description = The small fraction of star surface. The fragments shattered among deep cosmic after the star goes supernova. Can be found mostly in outer and dead planets.
item.jab-ec-arronium.description = Highly radioactive pulse-nuclear but safe to be touched. Explode violently while emphasized.

## ITEM: DETAILS
item.jab-ec-chondrite.details = Chondrite is common mineral to be found in asteroids. It also contains lots chondrules (metallic particle that rapidly crystallized in minutes to hours) and some metals in the form of solid or liquid (melted).
item.jab-ec-radhox.details = Highly radioactive stone that formed from star radiation-exposed chondrite in vacuum spaces around million of years. It is also emits radiation ray unpredictably. In some states it can form carbon-based lifeform, and causes strange behavior with silicon-based lifeforms.
item.jab-ec-cosmonium.details = This metal is the strange form of chondrite and soft rather than solid-hard like other metals. It formed when chondrite is spontaneously exposed by high unknown cosmic radiation within billions of years. It emits pulses of dark energy and acts strangely when exposed to star radiation. It can also manipulates dimensions when trapped in high distortion of spacetime fabric. Perhaps it can be used as new technology in the future? Who knows...
item.jab-ec-techronite.details = Shining purple cosmic crystal that still unknown from what it is formed by. Every photons which pass or reflected by this crystal always behaves strangely. If you seeing something through this crystal, you will see magic that cannot be described...
